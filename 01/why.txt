I'm taking this class so that I can finally dive into the techie world and be around others who like to tinker and look under the hood like I do.  Iâ€™m looking forward to creating a solid foundation of web development from the course.  I want to understand what I am doing, learn from many mistakes, discover things I didn't know I needed until learning about them in this class, and sharing (more like learning from other's) ideas.

I like web sites that teach me something new and show me something that I didn't know I needed until I read about it:

Love the Mac Power Users podcast.
I would be very interested to learn about some new resources relating to web development.
