I'm taking this class so that I can finally dive into the techie world and be around others who like to tinker and look under the hood like I do.  I am looking forward to creating a solid foundation from the course.  I want to understand what I am doing, learning from many mistakes, discovering things I didn't know I needed until learning about them in this class, and sharing (more like learning from other's) ideas.

I like web sites that teach me something new and show me something that I didn't know I needed until I read about it:
Design Taxi: http://designtaxi.com
boingboing: http://boingboing.net
css zen garden:  http://www.csszengarden.com
http://www.zeldman.com
http://brettterpstra.com
http://www.smashingmagazine.com
http://www.macstories.net

I like some of the design in these web sites:  I have a thing for fonts, so it probably has more to do with that!
