    <p>I like to travel--it can be for a day or for longer.  Lately water has been calming for me, it puts me in a happy place.  I really connect with areas where I can see the water flow.  It could be by taking a walk in Canton to Harbor East or it could be walking along the canals in Venice or Amsterdam.</p>
    <p>Since I have been enjoying water these days, I really want to learn how to kayak.  It seems like a good slow-paced activity.  I can get a good workout, but enjoy the scenery along the way.  I just hope I don't spend my whole time learning how not to topple over!</p>
    <p>Cooking is another interest of mine.  I like to combine the flavors of where I have recently traveled and add them to my arsenal of recipes.  My latest interest is with lemon zest.  It flavor many different dishes I had in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorrento">Sorrento</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positano">Positano</a>.  Amazing that a seemingly ordinary, everyday fruit can add so much to a dish.</p>
